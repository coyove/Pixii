# Pixii

Pixii is a 12px monospaced pixel font especially created for the ease of Chinese and Japanese language.

## Build TTF

Install Go and run `go run bdf2sfd.go` to get the outline sfd. Then use FontForge to generate the ttf (or any other supported formats)

## WIP

In plane 0, 28587 are covered.

## Copyright

Pixii is for personal use only as the majority of CJK glyphs were taken from SimSun (and WenQuanYi for complement).
